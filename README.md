# Unemployment Analysis with Python

## Problem Statement
Unemployment is a major economic indicator, reflecting the share of people in the labor force who are jobless and actively looking for work. The COVID-19 pandemic caused major shifts in labor markets worldwide, resulting in rising unemployment. This project analyzes these changes through data to uncover key patterns and causes.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to examine unemployment trends using Python, with a special focus on the period affected by COVID-19. It aims to identify contributing factors, explore data relationships, and provide clear, actionable insights.

## Key Areas
- Study of unemployment rate as a measure of labor market health
- Assessment of COVID-19 impact on employment trends
- Python-based data analysis and visualizations
- Data-backed recommendations for policy and recovery

## Data Analysis Process
1. Data Collection and Processing
2. Data Wrangling and Preprocessing
3. Statistical Analysis
4. Visualization and Pattern Recognition

## Key Findings
- Significant increase in unemployment rates during lockdown compared to pre-lockdown period
- Regional variations in unemployment impact
- Consistent employment patterns in major population centers
- Strong correlation between unemployment rates and employed workforce metrics

## Technical Implementation
- Python for data analysis
- Libraries used: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Statistical analysis and data visualization
- Time series analysis of pre and post lockdown periods

## Project Structure
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Statistical measurements
- Visual representations
- Correlation analysis

## Conclusions
The analysis reveals significant economic disruption during the COVID-19 pandemic with varying regional impacts. States showed different levels of resilience, with some maintaining stable employment levels while others experienced severe unemployment increases.
